## Comments

I had a difficult time with how layered, interwoven and frankly complex writing code in Javascript can be. It's like learning how to build websites all over again when you have to consider the amount of interactive possibilities that are available. To make matters even more complicated - Javascript also uses a highly specific coding language. jQuery removes a lot of the pedantic and excess code that Javascript can sometimes require (as this assignment demonstrates - the difference between altering HTML with jq instead of js language is a revelation) but it uses similar coding concepts. The two languages work well together, almost like a left brain and right brain.
